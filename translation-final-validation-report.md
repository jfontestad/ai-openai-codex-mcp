**Certification Date:** 2025-09-18 (US Central)
**Coordinator:** Codex Orchestration Lead

## 1. Certification Statement
All active repository files have been inspected and confirmed to contain English-only, ASCII characters. Original-language backups reside under `.backup/original-language/` and are intentionally excluded from translation. Build and smoke tests succeed using the translated assets.

---

## 2. Completed Scope

| Scope Area | Files Covered | Status |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| Canonical specification & high-priority docs | 7 | Complete |
| Reference documentation & configuration samples | 18 | Complete |
| Source code comments & tooling | 9 | Complete |
| Scripts and utilities | 6 | Complete |
| Validation artifacts & workflows | 4 | Complete |

Total files validated: **44** (active repository contents including progress/validation reports, excluding backup directory).

---

## 3. Verification Evidence
- `rg --hidden --pcre2 "[^\\x00-\\x7F]" --glob '!/.backup/original-language/**' --glob '!/.git/**'` returned no matches.
- `npm run build`, `npm run mcp:smoke:ldjson`, `npm run mcp:smoke`, and `npm run test:tools-list` all executed successfully on 2025-09-18.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` comments translated to English while preserving behavior.
- `node_modules/` removed after verification to eliminate third-party Unicode.

---

## 4. Residual Items
- Backups: `.backup/original-language/` retains Japanese originals for audit/rollback. No action required.
- Future contributions should maintain English/ASCII compliance; consider adding automated linting to guard against regressions.

---

## 5. Sign-off
The translation initiative achieves 100% coverage. Repository is ready for English-speaking collaborators, with verifiable backups and test evidence on record.
