# External System Policy Sample (policy.md.example)

This file is a sample for replacing response policies (System Prompt) from an external source. It is referenced by YAML configuration.

- Or completely replace it using replace

Example (`~/.config/openai-responses-mcp/config.yaml`):
```
policy:
  system:
    source: file
    path: ~/.config/openai-responses-mcp/policy.md
    merge: append   # replace | prepend | append
```
