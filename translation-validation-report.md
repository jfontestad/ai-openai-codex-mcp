---

## Impact Assessment

### Before Translation
- **Project comprehension**: Blocked by Japanese language barrier
- **International collaboration**: Severely limited
- **Documentation accessibility**: Restricted to Japanese speakers
- **Maintenance efficiency**: Hindered by language mixing

### After Translation (Current State)
- **Core understanding**: ✅ Fully accessible via translated spec and README
- **Setup capability**: ✅ Users can understand installation and configuration
- **Policy comprehension**: ✅ System policies clearly documented
- **Development readiness**: ✅ Foundation established for broader contribution

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks ✅ Mitigated
1. **Functionality Regression**: Prevented through systematic testing
2. **Translation Errors**: Addressed through technical term preservation
3. **Context Loss**: Avoided through semantic translation approach
4. **Rollback Needs**: Handled through comprehensive backup system

### Remaining Considerations
1. **Completion Timeline**: Remaining files need systematic completion
2. **Terminology Consistency**: Cross-file validation needed for remaining files
3. **Community Review**: Translated content should be reviewed by native speakers

## Recommendations for Completion

### Phase 1 Completion (Highest Priority)
1. Complete remaining 4 high-priority files
2. Focus on client-setup-claude.md and reproducibility.md next
3. Handle src/policy/system-policy.ts comments
4. Complete docs/README.md

### Phase 2 Approach (Medium Priority)
1. Prioritize documentation files in docs/reference/
2. Handle source code comments systematically
3. Maintain build testing between files

### Phase 3 Strategy (Low Priority)
1. Address utility scripts last
2. Focus on console output and comments
3. Maintain consistency with established terminology

## Conclusion

The systematic translation project has successfully completed the most critical components of the repository translation, establishing a solid foundation for international collaboration. The canonical specification (docs/spec.md), main project documentation (README.md), and core system policies have been fully translated while preserving all technical functionality.

**Current State**: **Project is accessible to English-speaking developers** with core documentation translated and full functionality preserved.

**Success Metrics Achieved**:
- ✅ Zero functionality regression
- ✅ Core documentation 100% translated  
- ✅ Build and test systems fully operational
- ✅ Comprehensive backup and rollback capability
- ✅ Translation tracking system established
- ✅ International collaboration barriers removed for core functionality

The remaining files can be completed using the established systematic approach while maintaining the same high standards for technical accuracy and functionality preservation.
