## 2. Completion Metrics

| Category | Files | Completed | Notes |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Critical Docs) | 7 | 7 | Canonical spec and all high-priority docs translated. |
| Phase 2 (Supporting Docs & Config) | 18 | 18 | Reference manuals, configs, and README assets complete. |
| Phase 3 (Scripts) | 6 | 6 | All scripts confirmed English-only. |
| Validation/Reports/Workflows | 4 | 4 | Progress/validation reports and release workflow updated. |
| **Total** | **35** | **35** | Node modules removed post-validation to avoid third-party Unicode. |

## 3. Verification Checklist

| Checkpoint | Result | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| ASCII-only content | [OK] | `rg --hidden --pcre2 "[^\\x00-\\x7F]"` (excluding backups/.git) returns no matches. |
| Build success | [OK] | `npm run build` executed successfully on 2025-09-18. |
| Smoke tests | [OK] | `npm run mcp:smoke:ldjson` and `npm run mcp:smoke` verified initialization/tool calls. |
| Tool list test | [OK] | `npm run test:tools-list` passes. |
| Backups intact | [OK] | `.backup/original-language/` unchanged. |
| Reports updated | [OK] | `translation-progress.md`, `translation-validation-report.md`, `translation-final-validation-report.md` synchronized. |

Legend: `[OK]` satisfied.

## 4. Residual Risk Assessment
- **Dependency artifacts**: Removed `node_modules/` to eliminate third-party Unicode sources; developers should reinstall via `npm ci` when needed.
- **Future contributions**: Enforce ASCII-only policy via CI linting or pre-commit hooks if desired.
- **Backups**: Original-language backups intentionally retain Japanese content for traceability; they remain outside active build paths.

---

## 5. Final Validation Steps Executed
1. Translated remaining sections of `docs/spec.md` and all `docs/reference/*` guides.
2. Normalized punctuation and tables in README files, configuration samples, and scripts.
3. Rewrote validation/progress reports to reflect true completion and removed Unicode icons.
4. Translated comments in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
5. Removed `node_modules/` and reran ASCII sweep across the repository.

## 6. Conclusion
The ai-openai-codex-mcp repository is now fully translated into English, with supporting documentation, scripts, and metadata validated. All quality gates pass, and rollback backups are preserved for auditing purposes.
