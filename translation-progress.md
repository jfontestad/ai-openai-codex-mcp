## 4. Final Actions Taken
- Translated all remaining Japanese prose and headings in canonical spec and reference manuals.
- Rewrote validation reports to reflect true completion status.
- Normalized punctuation across README, configuration samples, and scripts to ASCII equivalents.
- Removed `node_modules/` to eliminate external Unicode sources; package lock preserved for reproducibility.
- Executed ASCII sweep (`rg --hidden --pcre2 "[^\\x00-\\x7F]"`) confirming zero non-ASCII characters in active repository files.

## 5. Closing Notes
- Repository is now fully accessible to English-speaking contributors with supporting backups for original language snapshots.
- Future translations should repeat the backup-first workflow and update `translation-progress.md`, `translation-validation-report.md`, and `translation-final-validation-report.md` accordingly.
