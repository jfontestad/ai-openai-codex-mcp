## Translation Planning Recommendations

### Phase 1: Critical Documentation (High Priority)
**Estimated effort:** 40-60 hours
**Target timeframe:** 2-3 weeks

1. `docs/spec.md` - 694 lines - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
2. `README.md` - 218 lines
3. `docs/reference/system-policy.md` - 75 lines
4. `docs/reference/client-setup-claude.md` - 136 lines
5. `docs/reference/reproducibility.md` - 140 lines
6. `docs/README.md` - 93 lines
7. `src/policy/system-policy.ts` - 39 lines (comments only)

### Phase 2: Development Documentation (Medium Priority)
**Estimated effort:** 30-40 hours
**Target timeframe:** 3-4 weeks

Focus on the 16 medium-priority files, starting with:
1. Documentation files (docs/reference/*.md)
2. Core source files with significant comment content
3. Configuration and setup files

### Phase 3: Utility Scripts (Low Priority)
**Estimated effort:** 10-15 hours
**Target timeframe:** 1-2 weeks

Translation of comments and console output in utility scripts.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Preservation Requirements
- **Code functionality:** All code logic must remain unchanged
- **File structure:** Maintain original file organization
- **Technical terms:** Preserve API names, configuration keys, and technical identifiers
- **Formatting:** Maintain markdown structure and code block formatting

### Translation Guidelines
- **Japanese -> English:** Primary translation direction
- **Bilingual approach:** Consider maintaining both languages where critical
- **Technical accuracy:** Ensure technical concepts are accurately conveyed
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent terminology across all files

## Impact Assessment

### Current Barriers for English-Speaking Contributors
1. **Project Understanding:** Core specifications are primarily in Japanese
2. **Setup and Configuration:** Installation guides require Japanese comprehension
3. **Development:** Source code comments and error messages in Japanese
4. **Maintenance:** Change logs and documentation updates in Japanese

### Expected Benefits Post-Translation
1. **International Collaboration:** Enable global contributor participation
2. **Project Accessibility:** Lower barrier to entry for new developers
3. **Documentation Quality:** Improved maintainability with standardized language
4. **Community Growth:** Potential for broader adoption and contribution

## Conclusion

This repository requires comprehensive translation from Japanese to English to achieve international accessibility. The analysis reveals a well-structured codebase with extensive documentation, but the language barrier significantly limits its potential for global collaboration.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with systematic translation starting with the highest priority files, focusing on preserving technical accuracy while making the project accessible to English-speaking developers.
